Notes:

Great job!

It's not the most important thing, but for practice, next time, see if you can add some media queries, and make the page more repsonsive for mobile devices. 

I would also consider trying other ways of templating the data (like in your showInfo() function). You might use backticks and interpolate any data into a string containing your <tr> and <td> elements, for example. It might simplify your code.
